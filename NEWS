News for libStorageMgmt

1.1.1: Dec 4 2014
    - Library adds:

      API Constants for new pool element types and plugin changes to support it
      * C constants:
         LSM_POOL_ELEMENT_TYPE_VOLUME_FULL, LSM_POOL_ELEMENT_TYPE_VOLUME_THIN
      * Py constants:
         Pool.ELEMENT_TYPE_VOLUME_FULL, Poll.ELEMENT_TYPE_THIN

      lsmcli:
      * lt - Alias for 'list --type target_ports'
      * Removed --init for volume-mask, it was broken for targetd (the only
        user) and instead of fixing we are going to improve targetd to support
        access groups in the next release

    - Numerous code improvements, including a big SMI-S plugin refactor,
      source code documentation corrections

    - Bug fix: Use correct default values for anonymous uid/gid in lsmcli

      *  fs_child_dependency
      *  fs_child_dependency_rm
      *  fs_snapshot_restore
    - Bug fix: lsm_restd memory leak corrections
    - Bug fix: NetApp plugin, correctly set export path when caller specifies
      default in API
    - Bug fix: Add file locking to sim plugin to prevent concurrent modification
    - Bug fix: Consistently report common error conditions for NO_STATE_CHANGE,
      EXISTS_INITIATOR for all plugins
    - Bug fix: Number of bugs addressed in SMI-S plugin including:
      * EMC: Correct error path when replicating a volume with a duplicate
        volume name
      * HDS: Correctly create thinly provisioned volume on thinly provisioned
        pool
